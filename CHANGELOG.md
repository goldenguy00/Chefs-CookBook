# Changelog
Dates are listed in `MM/DD/YY` format.

---

## v1.2.6 — 12/29/25
### Added
- Added sorting support to crafttUI to sort based on item type (visual only to avoid recomputation)

---

## v1.2.5 — 12/29/25
### Fixed
- Added inter-client confirmation via networked commands so that non-modded users can still participate (it sends the objective in raw text via chat!)
- Muted command audio to not play the annoying chat blip on send
- Further optimized craftplanner backend

---

## v1.2.4 — 12/29/25
### Changed
- Err... I may have accidentally been attempting to call a networked event from the client, which explains why crafting wasnt working on non-host clients in multiplayer... Fixed now!
- Finalized chat-based networking! invisible to the player, and completely avoids the messy ror2 netcode!

---

## v1.2.3 — 12/28/25
### Changed
- Added tint for ingredient sources to differentiate self sourced items from traded items. Cleaned up ingredient icon templating to eliminate runtime costs, just instantiation now.

---

## v1.2.2 — 12/28/25
### Added
- Multiplayer pooling support, please provide feedback on this. it relies on the SPEX npc to transfer items between allied players.
- Added Risk_Of_Options integration for configuring crafting depth, multiplayer pooling, and other relevant features. Please suggest any other configurable settings that are missing.
### Changed
- Further optimized the craftexecutionhandler to now only handle iterating through the steps generated by the craftplanner. The craftplanner now properly adds drone scrap and/or trading steps.
- To provide more choice for the user , item trades and Drone Scrap paths are now shown in parallel rather than exclusively preferring a specific route type.

---

## v1.2.1 — 12/28/25
### Fixed
- Refactored the craftplanner backend filtering to be more lenient on potentially useful crafting chains (ex:4x drones -> 4x green scrap -> 2x regen scrap -> red scrap), while still culling wasteful chains before ui time.
### Changed
- RecipeProvider now consolidates bulked recipes (recipes with more than 1 of an ingredient), allowing cheaper chain traversal as we dont need to iterate over all individual ingredients.

---

## v1.2.0 — 12/27/25
### Added
- Added Drone scrap support.
- Added **Objectives** to make Crafting State more clear to the user.
- Added a **hotkey** for aborting a craft. Currently set to holding *left alt*. Will be configurable eventually once I get around to it.
### Fixed
- Replaced usage of massive int arrays with sparse dictionaries to greatly reduce memory usage. (11 GB game usage -> ~3.6 with identical inventory).
- No longer fully rebuilds paths on inventory change, preserves unchanged paths from previous snapshot.
- Reduced menu rendering time by nearly a factor of 4 in typical scenarios via sparse reads.
- Fixed the pathrow buttons consuming scroll actions (no one mentioned this somehow :sob:)
### Changed
- Reduced pressure on garbage collection from reinitializing a bunch of arrays for calculating chain costs,. Now uses a "scratchpad" that just repeatedly gets cleared (no repeated initialization calls).
- Reworked path planning to take a lazy approach to reduce passive mem usage.

---
